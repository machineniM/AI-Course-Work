Amazon review sentiment analysis:
https://www.kaggle.com/bittlingmayer/amazonreviews
This dataset is an extract from the Amazon Reviews Kaggle competition. The goal is to perform
sentiment analysis to determine whether a review is positive or negative. We have provided a
CSV file on D2L which contains the binary label (positive/negative) and the corresponding text
for the 400,000 reviews.

The CSV file can be read using the command:
Import["reviews.csv", "Table", FieldSeparators -> "|"]
